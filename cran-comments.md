## Notes
I have tried to test extensively on all possible platforms, but I can't reproduce the previous Debian/Fedora clang 11 error. I made a few updates to the vignettes, so hopefully this will resolve the issue. 

## Test environments
* Mac OS X 10.15.7 (local install), R 4.0.3
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci): r-oldrel, r-release, r-devel
* win-builder: r-oldrel, r-release, r-devel
* AppVeyor
* Rhub:
  * debian-clang-devel (r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang)
  * fedora-clang-devel (r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang)

## R CMD check results
